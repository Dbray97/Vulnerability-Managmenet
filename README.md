<h2>Vulnerability-Managmenet Lab</h2>
<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, our main objective was to establish a secure Azure network, and we achieved this by setting up an Azure network with an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM. To create a realistic environment, we also developed a Windows 10 VM purposely designed with vulnerabilities, such as outdated software and disabled security controls. Using the powerful OpenVAS scanner, we conducted both unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans on the vulnerable Windows 10 VM. Through a thorough analysis of the scan results, we emphasized the distinctions between unauthenticated and credentialed scans, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of different scanning methods. Once vulnerabilities were identified, we proceeded to remediate them, ensuring successful resolution by conducting subsequent scans.<br />
